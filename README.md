## RAG-System
🧠✨ Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) is an advanced AI system that combines information retrieval with text generation. It takes unstructured documents 📄, converts them into vector embeddings 📊 using techniques like vectorization, and stores them in a vector database. When a user asks a question ❓, RAG retrieves the most relevant pieces of information and feeds them into a language model 🤖 to generate accurate and context-rich responses. It's like giving your chatbot a memory powered by real knowledge! 🚀


# Things to do
step 1 : Install all the requrment from requirements.txt

step 2 : To add a document to the RAG system, specify its file path by assigning it to the variable doc_path
